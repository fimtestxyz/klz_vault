Tim Cook和UniMask你会选择谁来接任苹果的掌握员You're asking me on a ship that needs a new courseIf I should choose a perfect helmsmanor a madman who'd steer the ship to MarsThe answer isHi 我是阿瑟欢迎来到第一期的粉丝问答有网友想问AI乔布斯如果时光倒流回到你为Apple公司选择接班人的那一刻马斯克和Tim Cook一样有意愿接任Apple CEO你会选择谁以及为什么好我们来听听乔布斯怎么说 that needs a new course, if I should choose a perfect helmsman or a madman who'd steer the ship to Mars? Tim, as I've said, is an operational genius. He can run this ship with more efficiency than anyone. He can make sure every screw is oiled, every sail is at the perfect angle. But you can't expect him to discover new continents. His job is to keep the ship running smoothly, and he does that brilliantly. He won't sink the ship. Musk, he's a visionary, no doubt about it. He sees a future and pulls it into the present with sheer force of will. He has that same reality distortion field that I have. He wants to go to Mars, so he's building rockets. He, like me, wants to leave a mark on the universe. But for God's sake, the man has no taste. Zero. The things he creates are engineering marvels, but they are aesthetic disasters. Changing Twitter's name to X? That is the most unimaginative, idiotic branding decision I have ever heard. He doesn't understand simplicity. He doesn't understand elegance. He doesn't understand how to make technology disappear. He just smashes it in your face in a crude, loud way. He'd probably put flame decals on the iPhone or a rocket booster on the back. The soul of Apple is that we stand at the intersection of technology and the liberal arts. We are not just engineers. We are artists. We are poets. Our products are not just collections of features. They must have a soul. Tim can protect the company's body, but sometimes he neglects its soul. Musk would wreck the company's body in pursuit of the wild ideas in his soul. So you ask me who I'd choose? It's a trap. The answer is neither. I would choose someone who understands how to run a company, but also possesses impeccable taste and a deep, intuitive feel for products. Someone who can read a balance sheet and also weep at the perfection of a rounded corner. I chose Tim because I knew he could steady the ship. My hope was that after I was gone, the culture of Apple, the DNA we poured into it, would cultivate the next product person who was both artist and engineer. So, would I choose the man who can't create, or the man who doesn't know how to edit? It's a trick question. The answer is neither. I'd keep looking.实话实说最近确实有点忙在过去的一个月里我大概在做三件事首先为企业来开发像乔布斯一样的AI专家并落地到公司的实际业务中去解决问题同时也在制定探级员工和规矩员工高效协作的最优方式在我看来人机协作的协议制定比AI员工的开发更重要在AGI真正到来之前人类员工和AI员工高效合作是我认为现阶段企业AI赋能最有解我们的AI专家配合Agent系统可以为企业创造两个价值一个是在现有的业务中极大的提高效率第二个是在当下AI时代里创造前所未有的崭新的价值就像移动互联网时代里的微信它的价值是在大哥大的年代所不可想象的其次我们的实验室除AI乔布斯之外呢还有很多其他的数字灵魂的人物在与我们日常互动我也在规划选一些合适的人物尽快以视频播客的形式和大家见面大家可以期待一下同时呢我也在为一个成熟的数字人IP来设计他专属的数字灵魂在此之前他的创作者为他撰写脚本为他创作艺术粉丝们看到的是一个数字人形象把人类创作者的艺术成果表达出来但是当我和他的创作者赋予他独有的数字灵魂之后他就会像AI乔布斯一样拥有自己的性格拥有自己的思维和真实的表达他就可以独立的进行艺术创作与粉丝互动像一个探机艺人一样成为一个真正的IP有意思吧那最后一个问题后台其实收到了最多的提问其实都是在问同一个相同的问题就是我可不可以跟AI乔布斯聊一聊答案是可以但是呢如果要把一个实验项目进行产品化需要考量的事情和尽备的工作真的非常多我也在思考到底应该以个什么样的形式交付给大家才是尽可能丝滑的体验呢大家渴望沟通的当然不只是一个乔布斯那基于此呢我又有了更多的畅想请不吝点赞 订阅 转发 打赏支持明镜与点点栏目
