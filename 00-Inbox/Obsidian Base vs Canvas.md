## What is the use of obsidian base and canvas

Obsidian **Base** is for structured, database‑like views of your notes; Obsidian **Canvas** is for visual, spatial thinking with notes on an infinite board.[effortlessacademic +1](https://effortlessacademic.com/using-obsidian-bases-for-academic-note-taking/)

## Obsidian Base

- Provides database-style views (tables, cards, galleries) over your markdown files, filtered by things like tags and properties.[effortlessacademic](https://effortlessacademic.com/using-obsidian-bases-for-academic-note-taking/)
- Useful for managing projects, literature notes, tasks, or any collection where you want to sort, filter, and review items systematically.[effortlessacademic](https://effortlessacademic.com/using-obsidian-bases-for-academic-note-taking/)

## Obsidian Canvas

- Gives you an infinite 2D space where you can place notes, cards, images, PDFs, and even live web pages, then connect them with arrows.[mindmappingsoftwareblog +1](https://mindmappingsoftwareblog.com/obsidian-canvas/)
- Useful for brainstorming, mapping ideas, designing systems, and building dashboards or “maps of content” when relationships and layout matter more than lists.[warrenweb](https://blog.warrenweb.net/visual-thinking-with-obsidian-canvas/) youtube

## How they work together

- Use Bases to collect and curate sets of notes (e.g., all notes for a project or topic) in a structured way.[warrenweb +1](https://blog.warrenweb.net/obsidian-bases-manage-knowledge-objects/)
- Pull selected notes from those Bases into a Canvas to visually cluster them, see patterns, design workflows, or plan writing and research outputs.[obsidian +1](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/bases-has-great-automate-potential-with-canvas/101479)
