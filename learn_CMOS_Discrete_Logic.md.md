# 🌳 CMOS & Discrete Logic — Rapid Landscape Map

## 1️⃣ AI MASTER PROMPT (Landscape + Tree View)

**Prompt to AI:**

You are an expert teacher and systems thinker.

Deconstruct **CMOS & Discrete Logic** so a fast learner can master it efficiently.

### Output requirements:
1. Present the topic as a **tree structure**:
   - Root → major branches → sub-branches
2. Clearly separate:
   - Core fundamentals
   - Advanced concepts
   - Edge cases & exceptions
3. Use concise, high-signal explanations

Start with a one-paragraph big-picture overview, then show the tree.
