Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking me to "summarise" after seeing two identical error messages about context length. 

First, I notice the user didn't actually provide any content to summarise - they're just referencing "BigBossbehind.md" which exists in the Context Library mentioned earlier. The user seems to be testing how I handle this situation where there's context but it appears garbled or truncated due to technical limitations.

The user might be frustrated because they're not getting the expected results. They probably want me to demonstrate how I would normally handle summarising an Obsidian note, but the corrupted content is making it difficult. 

I should explain that I can only work with what's provided, and the corrupted state prevents proper summarisation. The user might not realise that these error messages are system limitations rather than my response, so I need to clarify this without making them feel at fault.

The key points are:
1. The note exists in the context library
2. But it appears corrupted due to technical constraints
3. I need to explain this clearly while maintaining helpfulness

I should also acknowledge that the user might have intended for me to summarise their actual note content, not these error messages. The response should guide them toward providing the correct input format.

I see that you're referring to "BigBossbehind.md" which is available in the Context Library. However, I cannot see or access its content due to technical limitations preventing me from reading it properly.

To summarise the note, please provide its content directly in your query.

Okay, let's tackle this user query step by step based on the provided context. The user wants me to summarize "BigBossbehind.md" using only the information from the retrieved documents. 

First, I need to check if "BigBossbehind.md" is among the retrieved documents. Looking through them, I see titles like "ObsidianBasevsCanvas", "YT-WhyeveryoneHATESGPT-5(andhowtofixit)", "claudemcp", etc. There's no mention of "BigBossbehind.md" in the list, so it seems this note isn't included in the current context. 

The user might be referring to a personal Obsidian vault note that I don't have access to. Since the context doesn't include this specific note, I can only base my response on what's provided. 

Hmm, the user might be expecting me to pull information from "BigBossbehind.md" but since it's not in the context, I should clarify this limitation. They might have mentioned "BigBossbehind" earlier in the conversation, but without access to that note's content, I can't include it. 

I should also consider if there are any similar notes or references that could indirectly help with the summary. But none of the retrieved documents mention "BigBossbehind" or anything similar to it, so I can't infer any content. 

The user might be confused about why "BigBossbehind.md" isn't being retrieved or used. I should explain that the context is limited to specific notes, and "BigBossbehind.md" isn't among them. 

Since I can't access or summarize the user's personal vault note, my response should politely inform them of this limitation and ask for direct access to the content they want summarized. 

I need to make sure I'm following all the rules, especially rule 4 about not being able to access "BigBossbehind.md" properly. The user might have intended this note to be part of the context, but since it's not present in the retrieved documents, I can't include any information about it. 

In summary, my response should be clear that "BigBossbehind.md" isn't available in the current context, and I need them to provide its content directly for me to summarize it properly.
</think>
I'm unable to find or access the "BigBossbehind.md" note in the provided context. To summarize it, please provide its content directly in your query.
