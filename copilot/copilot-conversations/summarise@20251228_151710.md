Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking me to "summarise" after seeing two identical error messages about context length. 

First, I notice the user didn't actually provide any content to summarise - they're just referencing "BigBossbehind.md" which exists in the Context Library mentioned earlier. The user seems to be testing how I handle this situation where there's context but it appears garbled or truncated due to technical limitations.

The user might be frustrated because they're not getting the expected results. They probably want me to demonstrate how I would normally handle summarising an Obsidian note, but the corrupted content is making it difficult. 

I should explain that I can only work with what's provided, and the corrupted state prevents proper summarisation. The user might not realise that these error messages are system limitations rather than my response, so I need to clarify this without making them feel at fault.

The key points are:
1. The note exists in the context library
2. But it appears corrupted due to technical constraints
3. I need to explain this clearly while maintaining helpfulness

I should also acknowledge that the user might have intended for me to summarise their actual note content, not these error messages. The response should guide them toward providing the correct input format.
</think>
I see that you're referring to "BigBossbehind.md" which is available in the Context Library. However, I cannot see or access its content due to technical limitations preventing me from reading it properly.

To summarise the note, please provide its content directly in your query.
