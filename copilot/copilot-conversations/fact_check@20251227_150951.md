**user**: fact check

**ai**: The content you've shared discusses a prediction about China's population declining to 4 billion by the year 2100, citing factors such as an aging population and economic challenges. However, it does not provide specific factual evidence or references that would allow for a thorough fact-checking of this claim.

To properly fact-check this statement, we would need more detailed data from reliable sources on China's current demographics, future projections, and the underlying reasons behind any potential decline in population size. The video mentions several points such as an aging population (pension/CPF), high industrialization with AI supply chains leading to economic deadlock due to no consumers, and a declining total fertility rate (TFR).

Here are some steps you could take for fact-checking:

1. **Demographic Data**: Check the latest census data from China's National Bureau of Statistics or other reputable international organizations like the United Nations.
2. **Economic Indicators**: Look into economic reports that discuss China’s economy and its dependency on labor, including projections related to AI and automation.
3. **TFR Analysis**: Examine trends in total fertility rates over time for China and compare them with other countries facing similar demographic challenges.

If you have access to these resources or if there are specific parts of the video content that you would like me to verify, please provide more details so I can assist further.
