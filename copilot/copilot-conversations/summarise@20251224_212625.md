**ai**: The video discusses user dissatisfaction with GPT-5, a new AI model from OpenAI. The key points mentioned are:

1. **Personality Shift**: Many users dislike the new personality of GPT-5 compared to previous models like GPT-40 and 40 Pro.
2. **Forced Migration/Deletion**: Users were frustrated that OpenAI deleted older, more preferred models overnight without a choice or recourse.
3. **GPT-5 Performance**: Users criticize GPT-5 for being worse than expected in various aspects such as math problems, coding capabilities, and overall performance compared to
<errorChunk>Reached context length of 36000 tokens, but this model does not currently support mid-generation context overflow because llama_memory_can_shift is 0. Try reloading with a larger context length or shortening the prompt/chat.</errorChunk>
